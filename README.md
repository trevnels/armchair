# armchair

A new FRC scouting and analysis platform built around the Glicko-2 rating system, modified in a manner similar to Statbotics's EPA.

The system is designed around the lack of manual data entry - it should provide useful insights about events and teams without requiring one to sit in the stands and collect data.
